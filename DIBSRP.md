## What is DIBSRP? 

The Lab for Data Intensive Biology at the University of California Davis is excited to announce its inaugural summer research program for undergraduates. Participants will train in leading edge methods for the analysis of biological sequencing data. These skills are highly sought after in careers in industry, government, and academia. During their participation in our 8 to 10-week residential program at UC Davis interns will:

- Participate in bioinformatics training workshops for topics including introductory command line and unix
- Engage in a mentored summer project utilizing data science methods in biomedical research
- Learn how to use cloud computers for data analysis that can be conducted anywhere in the world
- Have fun!

## Program Goals

- Prepare participants from groups historically underrepresented minorities [https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2017/nsf17310/](https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2017/nsf17310/) for success in the rapidly growing field of data science
- Engage students in research at a tier one research university and the #1 ranked vet school in the world
- Teach participants data science skills (command-line, shell scripting, Python, etc.) for analysis of metagenomic and transcriptomic data.
- Help students produce poster and powerpoint presentations on their summer research projects that will be presented at an end of summer symposium and (where possible) other scientific meetings
- Review career options in computational biology and help prepare CVs, resumes, academic statements and personal statements needed for career and graduate school applications

## Program Eligibility 

- No computational experience required (i.e. command line or programming)
- Energy, enthusiasm, and an inquisitive mindset
- Currently enrolled in undergraduate degree-granting program in biological sciences, computer science or related field
- Member of a group underrepresented in science

## Costs

- Estimated costs include travel, room and board (~$600 per week)
- Funds may be available to defray costs when need is demonstrated.
